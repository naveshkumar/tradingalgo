R shiny begginers guide and flow of the app

CHAPTER 1 : THE BASICS

1.1 ui.R

the R file that contains your UI elements. What is meant by UI elements? : these are the input UX elements
that the end user will end up interacting with.

ANY UI element has the first parameter called the "inputid". This "inputid" is the name of the component and
this is the variable that will store the user's response to the change in the ui and store the output in an
object that is names as "inputid"

1.2 server.r

this is the r file where the "actual work" happens. the UI.R has got all the variables that it will send to the server.R. Server.R can itself call upon funcitons stored in a different R file but in the same working directory.

SEDNING STUFF BACK TO UI

the server app will create output$<object name> so as to send it back to the UI.R. The UI.R will expecte the <output object> to be "rendered" properly : however it is rendered (plot as renderplot, table as renderimage  and so on)

functions called from outside server.r need to specify where to call the function from

source("the_file_that_contains_the_function.R") is to be at the top of the the server.R so that you can recall where you are getting your functions from
